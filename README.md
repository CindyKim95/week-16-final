This is our Week 16 Final Project for Promineo Tech. This project is creating a React App using API or in memory storage, use React Router, have at least 3 pages using React Bootstrap or an alternative styling library, contain at least 10 components and allow all CRUD operations to work.

My project is a virtual book club named, The Reading Nook. On my webpage it has links named Home, Non-Fiction, Thriller and Romance. The pages include books that users can comment their thoughts/opinions on it as if we are in a book club virtually. I did use MockApi, using fake name and comments as well as a function for users to comment as well. 

To see all of my components, it will be in the final-project folder, then go to src.

Enjoy!
